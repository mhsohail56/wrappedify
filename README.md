# Wrappedify

Rudimentary data analysis app used to create a "wrapped" summary of usersâ€™ Spotify listening (similar to Spotify's end-of-the-year Wrapped) using Spotify's API, SvelteKit, and Express. Allows users to view up-to-date listening statistics such as top artists, favorite songs, and most-listened-to genres.
